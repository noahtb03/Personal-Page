            My name is Noah Bennett, and I aspire to become a software engineer. As a person I would 
            describe myself as a fast learner, a hard worker, and a team player. I have had interest 
            in computers for as long as I can remember. I first began learning about the way they work
            in high school where I took AP computer science. There I got my first real taste of coding 
            with java, basic data structures, algorithms, and programming concepts. Currently, I am
            searching for an internship which I hope will give me valuable experience within the world
            of computer science and software that will allow me to achieve my goal of becoming a
            software engineer.
